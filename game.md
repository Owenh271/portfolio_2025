<h1>Game Objective</h1>

Our game is about racing. You will be in a car and your objective is to drive around the map and finish faster than your friend in another car. The game will try to be as realistic as possible so that you won't have any buffs, or debuffs, just pure racing.

In this flow chart, we have background, players, and game mechanics, that can help build our game. There will be two cars, one will be controlled by you using WASD, and the other car can be controlled by someone else using the arrow keys. The cars will be different colors to differentiate between you and the other player. Our background will be a simple race track. You will start the race by talking to out Race driver NPC.

<h1>What did we do, and Whats in Progress?</h1>

As of right now, we have the sprite sheet of the cars, and an NPC that if you talk to starts the race, and the background of our game. We are still working on coding the game.
